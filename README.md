# SleepWell APP Backend/API

APIs were implemented to manage user authentication and integrate a machine learning model designed for face recognition to evaluate sleep sufficiency. The authentication API, utilizing Firebase Authentication, securely handles user registration, login, and token validation. The face recognition API leverages a TensorFlow.js model to analyze user-submitted facial images, identifying sleep adequacy by classifying the user's state as well-rested (Normal) or fatigued (Drowsy). This analysis provides actionable insights into the userâ€™s sleep quality. The backend APIs were deployed on Google Compute Engine (GCE) for scalability and reliability, with comprehensive testing conducted via Postman. Detailed API documentation was created to ensure seamless integration and support for future development needs.
